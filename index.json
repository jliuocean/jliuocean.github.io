Waves at the ocean surface play an important role in the GoM. These waves are significantly affected by ocean currents. Major ocean currents in the GoM include the Loop Current, which enters the GoM from the Yucatan channel and leaves through the Strait of Florida, and westward‐propagating eddies that are circular currents spanning a hundred kilometers or so. Our results show that mean wave heights are altered by up to 0.18 m (±15%) by currents in the GoM. The wind waves away from their origin, called swell, are substantial in summer in the northern GoM and in the southwestern GoM. They are able to drive the wind. The wind and the waves can also affect the mixing in the upper ocean differently across seasons and locations in the GoM, implying that their roles should be explicitly accounted for in computational ocean models.","tags":[],"title":"Surface Gravity Waves and Their Role in Ocean-Atmosphere Coupling in the Gulf of Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinliang Liu","Jun-Hong Liang","James C.

This study investigates sediment flocculation processes in wave‐driven Langmuir turbulence that is commonly observed in coastal ocean through embedding a size‐resolving flocculation model into a turbulence‐resolving hydrodynamic model. The specific research questions are how Langmuir turbulence affects flocculation processes and how flocculation processes impact the spatial and size distributions of suspended cohesive sediment. The results show that Langmuir turbulence suspends flocs in the water column and organizes flocs of different sizes. By modulating the encounter of flocs and redistributing flocs in the turbulence field, Langmuir turbulence enhances the aggregation and breakup rates of flocs that are located in similar regions with high turbulent dissipation rates and suppresses those of others. As an outcome of modulated flocculation processes, floc size distribution changes with depth and floc mass concentration profiles change with floc size. The addition of wave breaking increases the shear rate near the surface and reduces the median floc size and averaged settling velocity, leading to increase in total floc mass concentration in the whole water column. Wave breaking also increases cross‐shelf sediment transport by more than 15% under the simulated conditions, which is comparable to that due to Langmuir turbulence compared to shear turbulence. Both floc size distribution and floc concentration vary with wind and wave conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling sediment flocculation in Langmuir turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The animation shows the evolution of submesoscale fronts (a warm front between two cold fronts) simulated by LES model.\n        (a) Instantaneous buoyancy field, (b) surface buoyancy field, \u0026copy; horizontal velocity u, (d) vertical velocity w    The animation below shows the mixed layer baroclinic instability simulated by LES model.\n        (a) Instantaneous temperature field, (b) surface temperature, \u0026copy; vertical velocity at z=-1.8m, (d) vertical velocity w at z=-9.1m            Instantaneous vertical velocity    ","date":1561050000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561050000,"objectID":"79a58a94146536bfcc3712c18819da8b","permalink":"https://jliuocean.github.io/research/submeso/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T10:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/research/submeso/","section":"research","summary":"Submesoscale fronts and filaments can modify the vertical mixing.","tags":["Submesoscale processes"],"title":"Submesoscale processes","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Cohesive sediments exist as flocs of different sizes, which are built and destroyed through flocculation processes including both aggregation and breakup.

The focus is on the variability of the f_h effect with latitude/hemisphere in the presence of surface gravity waves and when capped by a stable stratification beneath the surface layer. When f_h is included, the mean flow, turbulence, and vertical mixing depend on the wind direction. The value and effect of f_h are the largest in the tropics and decrease with increasing latitudes. The variability in turbulent flows to wind direction is different at different latitudes and in opposite hemispheres. When limited by stable stratification, the variability in turbulence intensity to wind direction reduces, but the entrainment rate changes with wind direction. In wave-driven Langmuir turbulence, the variability in mean current to wind direction is reduced, but the variability of turbulence to wind direction is evident. When there is wind-following swell, the variability in the mean current to wind direction is further reduced. When there is strong wind-opposing swell so that the total wave forcing is opposite to the wind, the variability in the mean current to wind direction is reduced, but the variability of turbulence to wind direction is enhanced, compared to in Ekman turbulence.

We find that the sensitivity of the ACC transport is significantly weaker than previous studies. We attribute this difference to the different depth of the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Because a fast restoring buoyancy boundary condition is used that strongly constrains the surface buoyancy structure at the Southern Ocean surface, the ACC transport is determined by the isopycnal slope that is coupled to the overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean. By changing the surface buoyancy in the North Atlantic, the shared buoyancy contour between the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean is varied, and consequently the strength of the overturning circulation is modified. For different depth of the simulated overturning circulation, the response of the ACC transport to changes in the strength of the overturning circulation varies substantially. This is illustrated in two conceptual models based on the residual-mean theory of overturning circulation. Our results imply that the sensitivity of the ACC transport to surface forcing in the North Atlantic could vary substantially in different models depending on the simulated vertical structure of the overturning circulation.","tags":["Antarctic Circumpolar Current","Overturning circulation","North Atlantic"],"title":"Sensitivity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport to surface buoyancy conditions in the North Atlantic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Yu","Xueqing Zhang","**Jinliang Liu**","Rui Liu","Xing Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472713200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472713200,"objectID":"a3a118ada702e0e972e1b4be985d7764","permalink":"https://jliuocean.github.io/publication/yu-2016-numerical/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yu-2016-numerical/","section":"publication","summary":"The concept of water age is applied to calculate the timescales of the transport processes of freshwater in Lianzhou Bay, using a model based on ECOMSED.
