The focus is on the variability of the effect with latitude/hemisphere in the presence of surface gravity waves and when capped by a stable stratification beneath the surface layer. When is included, the mean flow, turbulence, and vertical mixing depend on the wind direction. The value and effect of are the largest in the tropics and decrease with increasing latitudes. The variability in turbulent flows to wind direction is different at different latitudes and in opposite hemispheres. When limited by stable stratification, the variability in turbulence intensity to wind direction reduces, but the entrainment rate changes with wind direction. In wave-driven Langmuir turbulence, the variability in mean current to wind direction is reduced, but the variability of turbulence to wind direction is evident. When there is wind-following swell, the variability in the mean current to wind direction is further reduced. When there is strong wind-opposing swell so that the total wave forcing is opposite to the wind, the variability in the mean current to wind direction is reduced, but the variability of turbulence to wind direction is enhanced, compared to in Ekman turbulence. The profiles of eddy viscosity, including its shape and its value, show a strong wind direction dependence for both stratified wind-driven and wave-driven Langmuir turbulence. Our study demonstrates that wind direction is an important parameter to upper-ocean mixing, though it is overlooked in existing ocean models.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of planetary rotation on oceanic surface boundary layer turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shantong Sun","Jinliang Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483250400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483250400,"objectID":"ec5de0908994cd82953473a1496c1f65","permalink":"https://jliuocean.github.io/publication/sun-2017-sensitivity/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2017-sensitivity/","section":"publication","summary":"The sensitivity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport to surface buoyancy conditions in the North Atlantic is investigated using a sector configuration of an ocean general circulation model. We find that the sensitivity of the ACC transport is significantly weaker than previous studies. We attribute this difference to the different depth of the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Because a fast restoring buoyancy boundary condition is used that strongly constrains the surface buoyancy structure at the Southern Ocean surface, the ACC transport is determined by the isopycnal slope that is coupled to the overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean. By changing the surface buoyancy in the North Atlantic, the shared buoyancy contour between the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean is varied, and consequently the strength of the overturning circulation is modified. For different depth of the simulated overturning circulation, the response of the ACC transport to changes in the strength of the overturning circulation varies substantially. This is illustrated in two conceptual models based on the residual-mean theory of overturning circulation. Our results imply that the sensitivity of the ACC transport to surface forcing in the North Atlantic could vary substantially in different models depending on the simulated vertical structure of the overturning circulation.","tags":["Antarctic Circumpolar Current","Overturning circulation","North Atlantic"],"title":"Sensitivity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport to surface buoyancy conditions in the North Atlantic","type":"publication"}]
