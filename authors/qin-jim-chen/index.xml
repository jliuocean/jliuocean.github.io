      <description>The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is a marginal sea that provides many critical resources for the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. Waves at the ocean surface play an important role in the GoM. These waves are significantly affected by ocean currents. Major ocean currents in the GoM include the Loop Current, which enters the GoM from the Yucatan channel and leaves through the Strait of Florida, and westward‐propagating eddies that are circular currents spanning a hundred kilometers or so. Our results show that mean wave heights are altered by up to 0.18 m (±15%) by currents in the GoM. The wind waves away from their origin, called swell, are substantial in summer in the northern GoM and in the southwestern GoM. They are able to drive the wind. The wind and the waves can also affect the mixing in the upper ocean differently across seasons and locations in the GoM, implying that their roles should be explicitly accounted for in computational ocean models.</description>
